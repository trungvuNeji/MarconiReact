To start the project, just run

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The webpage will be opened up at localhost:3000, and will be auto-reload upon every save.

For the production, please run
```bash
$ npm run build
```

It will create the build folder that has all the static html and bundle.js files.
