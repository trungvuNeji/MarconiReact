# Marconi

This was set up using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for fast set up. All the webpack and liver-reload are already included.

Every changes should be made in the `src` folder.

To start the project, just run

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The webpage will be opened up at localhost:3000, and will be auto-reload upon every save.

For the production, please run
```bash
$ npm run build
```

It will create the build folder that has all the static html and bundle.js files.

## For i18next

Under `src`, there's `utils` folder where I keep all the translation files.
